# Star Palace Prediction Market on Blockchain

## Abstract

Star Palace is a prediction market on blockchain. It is a platform where users can create and trade prediction markets.
The platform is built on the Astar blockchain and uses the ERC-20 token standard for the creation and trading of
prediction markets. The platform is designed to be decentralized, censorship-resistant, and trustless. The platform is
also designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use. We closed Star Palace in the spring of 2022 due to the running
cost of the server.
