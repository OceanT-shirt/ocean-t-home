# My Homepage

Main dir is in `home`. This is my portfolio website powered by Next.js 13 and Firestore

## ls

- `home` : the main dir
- `homev1` : old version portfolio site using React.js, three.js
- `backend` : old version cms using Golang, Auth0

## version history

I used to developing `homev1` . However, I decided to stop developing it because it was too heavy and I realized it
cannot meet the main target's (Recruiters') needs.

...and SQL servers are pricy :p

# HomeV1

HomeV1 is the latest version of the portfolio site. It is powered by React.js, three.js.

## Great Thanks

This website is inspired by React Three Fiber's official example, ["Image Gallery"](https://codesandbox.io/s/lx2h8) by
Paul Henschel. Thank you so much for the great example!

## Camera Controls

- Basically handling the location from cameraControl.tsx
- Managing state of camera in CameraPosProvider.tsx
